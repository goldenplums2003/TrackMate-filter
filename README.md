# TrackMate-filter
When using TrackMate to track RBCs in vessels, do you often experience tons of garbage tracks that cannot be removed by inbuilt filters? Here is a wonderful new filter for you!

This is a two step filter. First use the SortingAndFiltering code to filter away tracks that are moving upwards, downwards and in false directions. Then run the FilteringAwayRidiculousPoints code to remove the rest signal noises.
